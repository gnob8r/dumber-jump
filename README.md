## About
**Dumb Jump** is a "jump to definition" package for Emacs. Dumb Jump uses `grep` behind the scenes to find the definition of a variable/function under point via a set of regular expressions based on the file extension of the current buffer. This makes it dead simple to both get started and support additional programming languages.
